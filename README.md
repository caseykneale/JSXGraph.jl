# JSXGraph

[jsxgraph](https://github.com/jsxgraph/jsxgraph) is a nice project to have interactive plots in the browser, it's a bit like Plotly except more geared towards maths and interactivity.

This package aims to help generate JSXGraph code that can then be plugged in a statically served website (for instance one you would generate via [Franklin.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl)).
